## Key Insights for Presentation
The presentation focuses on cultural aspects trying to answer the question of ***did filmmaking and cinema evolved culturally and socially since its beginning till recent years?*** I tried to reach an answer from 3 points of view:
- 1. Original Language in Films: the top languages represented in film.
- 2. Spoken Languages in Film: the number of languages spoken in films, which can represent culture diversity in cinema.
- 3. Gender in Film: how are women and men represented in filmmaking in cinema?

## Summary of Findings

Film industry evolved culturally over time to contain more languages and give more space to divese cultures to engage with it. However, women are underrepresented in cinema. They got to be more involved in the film industry, not just in filmmaking, but all roles, including cinematographers, film producers, film critics, and other film industry professions.

#### General Insights:
- The higher rating a film has doesn't necessarily mean the more popular or acclaimed. Even with the *enough* amount of voters, there isn't a proven relationship between rating and popularity in cinema.
- Many cultures are interested in cinema, but they lack popularity due to the barrier of language.
- There's a trend among people leaning towards recent movies, starting from 2000 to now, with a few exceptions.

#### Gender-study-related Insights:
- There's a wide gender gap between women and men filmmakers contributing in the industry. Reasons aren't clear which gives the space for another elaboration and usage of regression analysis.
- Women only began to direct films later than men, and only increased starting 2000.
- Films' ratings for both men and women have almost the same average, close minimum and maximum points, suggesting that the lack of women in film industry isn't due to their lack of skill or talent.
